This edition of the 'GNU Direvent' manual, last updated 18 September
2014, documents GNU Direvent Version 5.0.90.

1 Introduction
**************

GNU 'direvent' monitors events in file system directories.  For each
event that occurs in a set of pre-configured directories, the program
calls an external program associated with it, supplying it the
information about the event and the location within the file system
where it took place.

   GNU 'direvent' provides an easy way to configure your system to react
immediately if certain files undergo changes.  This may be helpful, for
example, to track changes in important configuration files.

   Interfaces for tracking changes to file systems are highly
system-specific.  GNU 'direvent' aims to provide a uniform and
system-independent command-level interface.  As of version 5.0.90
'direvent' works with modern Linux kernels (since v.  2.6.13) and BSD
systems (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin).

2 Overview
**********

GNU 'direvent' monitors a set of directories on the file system and
reacts when a file system event occurs in any of them.  Directories and
events to monitor are specified in the configuration file.  When an
event occurs, the program reacts by invoking an external command
configured for that event.

   File system events can be divided into two major groups.  The
"system-dependent events" are specific for each particular kernel
interface.  In the contrast, "generic events" don't depend on the
underlying system.  They provide a higher level of abstraction and make
it possible to port GNU 'direvent' configurations between various
systems and architectures.

   The generic events are:

create
     A file was created.
delete
     A file was deleted;
write
     A file was written to;
attrib
     File attributes have changed.  This includes changes in the file
     ownership, mode, link count, etc.

   A "watcher" is a configuration entity that associates a set of
directories with a set of events and instructs 'direvent' to run a
specified external command when any of these events occur in any of
these directories.  This external command (called a "handler") can
obtain information about the event that triggered it from the
environment variables, or from its command line.

   Watchers are defined in the configuration file, which 'direvent'
reads at startup.  This file has a simple and easy to use syntax.

   Three types of comments are allowed: inline comments, that begin with
a '#' or '//' and extend to the end of line, and multi-line comments,
which comprise everything enclosed between '/*' and '*/'.  Comments and
empty lines are ignored.  Whitespace characters are ignored as well,
except as they serve to separate tokens.

   A token is a string of consecutive characters from the following
classes: alphanumeric characters, underscores, dots, asteriscs, slashes,
semicolons, commercial at's, and dashes.

   Any other sequence of characters must be enclosed in double quotation
marks in order to represent a single token.

   Adjacent quoted strings are concatenated.

   A configuration statement consists of a keyword and value separated
by any amount of whitespace and is terminated with a semicolon.  A block
statement is a collection of statements enclosed in curly braces.

   The following block statement declares a watcher:

     watcher {
         path PATHNAME [recursive [LEVEL]];
         file PATTERN-LIST;
         event  EVENT-LIST;
         command COMMAND-LINE;
         user NAME;
         timeout NUMBER;
         environ ENV-SPEC;
         option STRING-LIST;
     }

   Each 'watcher' statement instructs 'direvent' to monitor events
listed in EVENT-LIST occurring in the directories specified by PATHNAMEs
in 'path' statements (any number of 'path' statements can be given).
When any such event is detected, the supplied COMMAND-LINE will be
executed.

   Each directory defined with the 'recursive' keyword will be watched
recursively.  This means that for each subdirectory created in it,
'direvent' will install a watcher similar to that of its parent
directory.  Optional LEVEL statement can be used to set up a cut-off
nesting level, beyond which the recursive operation is disabled.

   The rest of statements are optional.  The 'file' statement instructs
GNU 'direvent' to react only if the event concerned the file whose name
matches one of the patterns given in its argument.  The 'user' statement
can be used to execute the COMMAND-LINE as the user NAME (provided, of
course, that 'direvent' is started with root privileges).  The 'timeout'
specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds) the command is allowed
to run.  It defaults to 5.  The 'environ' statement modifies the command
environment.  Finally, the 'option' statement supplies additional
options.  It can be used, for example, to divert the command's output to
syslog.

3 Quick Start
*************

Let's suppose you have a directory where users can upload their files
and you want these files to be processed right after upload, in real
time.  Let this directory be '/home/ftp/incoming' and the program to
process the upload be '/usr/bin/upload'.  Let's also suppose that this
program expects name of the uploaded file as its argument.

   To make 'direvent' handle this task, you would need to create a
watcher for the upload directory which would handle the 'create' event:

     watcher {
         path /home/ftp/incoming;
         event create;
         # more statements follow...

   On this event, the watcher is to invoke '/usr/bin/upload' with the
name of the created file as an argument.  To make it possible, the
'direvent' configuration file provides "macro variables", which can be
used in the 'command' argument at configuration time and which are
expanded to the actual values before the command is executed.  Macro
variables are referred to using the same syntax as shell variables: a
dollar sign followed by the variable name, optionally enclosed in curly
braces.  The 'file' variable is expanded to the name of the file for
which the event is reported.  This name is relative to the current
working directory which, by the time the handler is executed, is set to
the directory where the event occurred.  Thus, the handler can be
configured as:

         command "/usr/bin/upload $file";

   To summarize, the watcher declaration is:

     watcher {
         path /home/ftp/incoming;
         event create;
         command "/usr/bin/upload $file";
     }

   Before invoking the handler, the following operations are performed:

  1. The current working directory is set to the directory where the
     event occurred.
  2. If the 'environ' statement is present in the watcher, the
     environment is modified according to its rules.  (*note environment
     modification: environ.)
  3. The standard input is closed.
  4. If the 'stdout' option is supplied, the standard output is captured
     and redirected to the syslog.  Otherwise it is closed.
  5. If the 'stderr' option is supplied, the standard error is captured
     and redirected to the syslog.  Otherwise it is closed.
  6. File descriptors above 2 are closed.
  7. Macro variables are expanded.  *Note macro expansion::.
  8. Word splitting is performed on the resulting command line.  The
     first word is treated as the pathname of the program to be
     executed.
  9. The program is invoked.

4 Invocation
************

The invocation syntax is:

     direvent  [OPTIONS] [CONFIG]

where OPTIONS are command line options discussed below and optional
CONFIG supplies the configuration file to use instead of the default
'/etc/direvent.conf'.

   The options are:

'-d'
'--debug'
     Increase debug level.
'-F NAME'
'--facility=NAME'
     Set syslog facility.
'-f'
'--foreground'
     Remain in foreground.
'-l PRIO'
     While connected to a terminal, 'direvent' outputs its diagnostics
     messages to stderr and, if configured, to syslog.  This option
     limits the amount of information output to the standard error.  The
     PRIO argument is one of the following priorities (in order of
     increasing severity): 'debug', 'info', 'notice', 'warning', 'err',
     'crit', 'alert', 'emerg'.  When this option is given, only messages
     with the priority level equal to or greater than PRIO will be
     duplicated on the standard error.
'-P FILE'
'--pidfile=FILE'
     Upon successful startup store the PID of the daemon process in
     FILE.
'-T COMMAND'
'--self-test=COMMAND'
     Run in "self-test mode".  In this mode, 'direvent' starts external
     command supplied as the argument to this option and continues
     running until the command exits.  If COMMAND terminates normally,
     'direvent' exits with the code returned by it.  If COMMAND
     terminates on signal, 'direvent' exits with code '0' if this signal
     was 'SIGHUP', and with code '2' otherwise.

     The COMMAND can include any command line options or arguments,
     provided that it is properly quoted.  It is invoked as '/bin/sh -c
     COMMAND' in the environment of the parent 'direvent' process.

     This mode is used in 'direvent' test suite.  The idea is to
     configure the handler (*note handler::) so that it sends 'SIGHUP'
     to COMMAND before exiting.  To this effect, the special macro
     variable '$self_test_pid' is defined (*note macro expansion::) to
     the PID of the running COMMAND process.  For example, consider
     configuration file 'test.conf', which contains the following:

          watcher {
              path /tmp;
              command "/bin/kill -HUP $self_test_pid";
          }

     Then, the following command can be used to check whether 'direvent'
     correctly reacts on file creation in the watched directory:

          $ direvent --foreground \
              --self-test 'touch /tmp/file && /usr/bin/sleep 20 && exit 1' \
              test.conf

     The command will return '0' if the handler was invoked, and '1' if
     it was not.
'-t'
'--lint'
     Check configuration file for errors and exit.
'-u NAME'
'--user=NAME'
     Run as this user.  This option overrides the 'user' configuration
     statement (*note user: general settings.).

   The following options are "informative".  They cause the program to
display the requested piece of information and terminate:

'-H'
'--config-help'
     Show configuration file summary.
'-h'
'--help'
     Give a short usage summary.
'--usage'
     Display available command line options.
'-V'
'--version'
     Print program version.

5 Configuration
***************


File: direvent.info,  Node: syntax,  Next: macro expansion,  Up: Configuration

5.1 Configuration Syntax
========================

The configuration file consists of statements and comments.

   There are three classes of lexical tokens: keywords, values, and
separators.  Blanks, tabs, newlines and comments, collectively called
"white space" are ignored except as they serve to separate tokens.  Some
white space is required to separate otherwise adjacent keywords and
values.


File: direvent.info,  Node: Comments,  Next: Pragmatic Comments,  Up: syntax

5.1.1 Comments
--------------

"Comments" may appear anywhere where white space may appear in the
configuration file.  There are two kinds of comments: single-line and
multi-line comments.  "Single-line" comments start with '#' or '//' and
continue to the end of the line:

     # This is a comment
     // This too is a comment

   "Multi-line" or "C-style" comments start with the two characters '/*'
(slash, star) and continue until the first occurrence of '*/' (star,
slash).

   Multi-line comments cannot be nested.  However, single-line comments
may well appear within multi-line ones.


File: direvent.info,  Node: Pragmatic Comments,  Next: Statements,  Prev: Comments,  Up: syntax

5.1.2 Pragmatic Comments
------------------------

Pragmatic comments are similar to usual single-line comments, except
that they cause some changes in the way the configuration is parsed.
Pragmatic comments begin with a '#' sign and end with the next physical
newline character.

'#include <FILE>'
'#include FILE'
     Include the contents of the file FILE.

'#include_once <FILE>'
'#include_once FILE'
     Same as '#include', except that, if the FILE has already been
     included, it will not be included again.

'#line NUM'
'#line NUM "FILE"'
     This line causes the parser to believe, for purposes of error
     diagnostics, that the line number of the next source line is given
     by NUM and the current input file is named by FILE.  If the latter
     is absent, the remembered file name does not change.

'# NUM "FILE"'
     This is a special form of '#line' statement, understood for
     compatibility with the C preprocessor.


File: direvent.info,  Node: Statements,  Prev: Pragmatic Comments,  Up: syntax

5.1.3 Statements
----------------

A "simple statement" consists of a keyword and value separated by any
amount of whitespace.  Simple statement is terminated with a semicolon
(';').

   The following is a simple statement:

     standalone yes;
     pidfile /var/run/direvent.pid;

   A "keyword" begins with a letter and may contain letters, decimal
digits, underscores ('_') and dashes ('-').  Examples of keywords are:
'expression', 'output-file'.

   A "value" can be one of the following:

number
     A number is a sequence of decimal digits.

boolean
     A boolean value is one of the following: 'yes', 'true', 't' or '1',
     meaning "true", and 'no', 'false', 'nil', '0' meaning "false".

unquoted string
     An unquoted string may contain letters, digits, and any of the
     following characters: '_', '-', '.', '/', '@', '*', ':'.

quoted string
     A quoted string is any sequence of characters enclosed in
     double-quotes ('"').  A backslash appearing within a quoted string
     introduces an "escape sequence", which is replaced with a single
     character according to the following rules:

     Sequence               Replaced with
     \a                     Audible bell character (ASCII 7)
     \b                     Backspace character (ASCII 8)
     \f                     Form-feed character (ASCII 12)
     \n                     Newline character (ASCII 10)
     \r                     Carriage return character (ASCII
                            13)
     \t                     Horizontal tabulation character
                            (ASCII 9)
     \v                     Vertical tabulation character
                            (ASCII 11)
     \\                     A single backslash ('\')
     \"                     A double-quote.

     Table 5.1: Backslash escapes

     In addition, the sequence '\NEWLINE' is removed from the string.
     This allows to split long strings over several physical lines,
     e.g.:

          "a long string may be\
           split over several lines"

     If the character following a backslash is not one of those
     specified above, the backslash is ignored and a warning is issued.

     Two or more adjacent quoted strings are concatenated, which gives
     another way to split long strings over several lines to improve
     readability.  The following fragment produces the same result as
     the example above:

          "a long string may be"
          " split over several lines"

Here-document
     A "here-document" is a special construct that allows to introduce
     strings of text containing embedded newlines.

     The '<<WORD' construct instructs the parser to read all the
     following lines up to the line containing only WORD, with possible
     trailing blanks.  Any lines thus read are concatenated together
     into a single string.  For example:

          <<EOT
          A multiline
          string
          EOT

     The body of a here-document is interpreted the same way as a
     double-quoted string, unless WORD is preceded by a backslash (e.g.
     '<<\EOT') or enclosed in double-quotes, in which case the text is
     read as is, without interpretation of escape sequences.

     If WORD is prefixed with '-' (a dash), then all leading tab
     characters are stripped from input lines and the line containing
     WORD.  Furthermore, if '-' is followed by a single space, all
     leading whitespace is stripped from them.  This allows to indent
     here-documents in a natural fashion.  For example:

          <<- TEXT
              The leading whitespace will be
              ignored when reading these lines.
          TEXT

     It is important that the terminating delimiter be the only token on
     its line.  The only exception to this rule is allowed if a
     here-document appears as the last element of a statement.  In this
     case a semicolon can be placed on the same line with its
     terminating delimiter, as in:

          help-text <<-EOT
                  A sample help text.
          EOT;

list
     A "list" is a comma-separated list of values.  Lists are enclosed
     in parentheses.  The following example shows a statement whose
     value is a list of strings:

          option (stdout,stderr);

     In any case where a list is appropriate, a single value is allowed
     without being a member of a list: it is equivalent to a list with a
     single member.  This means that, e.g.

          option wait;

     is equivalent to

          option (wait);

   A "block statement" introduces a logical group of statements.  It
consists of a keyword, followed by an optional value, and a sequence of
statements enclosed in curly braces, as shown in the example below:

     syslog {
       facility local0;
       tag "direvent";
     }

   The closing curly brace may be followed by a semicolon, although this
is not required.


File: direvent.info,  Node: macro expansion,  Next: general settings,  Prev: syntax,  Up: Configuration

5.2 Macro Expansion
===================

Arguments of some statements undergo macro expansion before use.  During
the macro expansion any occurrence of '$NAME' is replaced by the value
of the macro variable NAME.  Variable names follow the usual convention:
they begin with a letter and contain letters, digits and underscores.
Curly braces around the NAME are optional.  They are required only if
the macro reference is followed by a character that is not to be
interpreted as part of its name, as in '${command}string'.

   The following macros are defined:

file
     Name of the file that triggered the event.

genev_code
     Generic (system-independent) event code.  It is a bitwise OR of the
     event codes represented as a decimal number.

genev_name
     Generic event name.  If several generic events are reported
     simultaneously, the value of this variable is a list of event names
     separated by space characters.  Each name corresponds to a bit in
     '$genev_code'.

self_test_pid
     The PID of the external command started with the '--self-test'
     option (*note self-test mode::).  If 'direvent' is started without
     this option, this variable is not defined.

sysev_code
     A system-dependent event code.  It is a bitwise OR of the event
     codes represented as a decimal number.

sysev_name
     A system-dependent event name.  If several events are reported, the
     value of this variable is a list of event names separated by space
     characters.  Each name corresponds to a bit in 'sysev_code'.  *Note
     System dependencies::, for a list of system-dependent event names.

5.3 General Settings
====================

 -- Config: user NAME
     Sets the user to run as.  The NAME argument must be a name of an
     existing user.

 -- Config: foreground BOOL
     Run in foreground.

 -- Config: pidfile FILE
     Upon successful startup store the PID of the daemon process in
     FILE.

 -- Config: debug NUMBER
     Set debug level.  Valid NUMBER values are '0' (no debug) to '3'
     (maximum verbosity).


File: direvent.info,  Node: syslog,  Next: watcher,  Prev: general settings,  Up: Configuration

5.4 Syslog
==========

While connected to the terminal, 'direvent' outputs its diagnostics and
debugging messages to the standard error.  After disconnecting from the
controlling terminal it closes the first three file descriptors and
directs all its output to the syslog.  When running in foreground mode,
its messages are sent both to the standard error and to the syslog.

   The following configuration statement controls the syslog output:

     syslog {
         facility STRING;
         tag STRING;
         print-priority BOOL;
     }

   The statements are:

 -- Config: facility STRING
     Set syslog facility.  The argument is one of the following: 'user',
     'daemon', 'auth' or 'authpriv', 'mail', 'cron', 'local0' through
     'local7' (case-insensitive), or a facility number.

 -- Config: tag STRING
     Tag syslog messages with 'string'.  Normally the messages are
     tagged with the program name.

 -- Config: print-priority 'bool'
     Prefix each message with its priority.

   An example 'syslog' statement:

     syslog {
         facility local0;
         print-priority yes;
     }


File: direvent.info,  Node: watcher,  Prev: syslog,  Up: Configuration

5.5 Watcher
===========

The 'watcher' statement configures a single event watcher.  A watcher
can control several events in multiple pathnames.  Any number of
'watcher' statements is allowed in the configuration file, each one of
them declaring a separate watcher.

     watcher {
         path PATHNAME [recursive [LEVEL]];
         file REGEXP-LIST;
         event EVENT-LIST;
         command COMMAND-LINE;
         user NAME;
         timeout NUMBER;
         environ ENV-SPEC;
         option STRING-LIST;
     }

   The statements within a 'watcher' block are:

 -- Config: path PATHNAME [recursive [NUMBER]]
     Defines a pathname to watch.  The PATHNAME argument must be the
     name of an existing directory in the file system.  The watcher will
     watch events occurring for all files within that directory.  If the
     optional 'recursive' clause is specified, this directory will be
     watched recursively, i.e.  when any subdirectory is created in it,
     'direvent' will set up a watcher for files in this subdirectory.
     This new watcher will be an exact copy of the parent watcher,
     excepting for the pathnames.  The optional NUMBER parameter defines
     a cut-off nesting level for recursive watching.  If supplied, the
     recursive behaviour will apply only to the directories that are
     nested below that level.

     Any number of 'path' statements can appear in a 'watcher' block.
     At least one 'path' must be defined.

 -- Config: file REGEXP-LIST
     Selects which files are eligible for monitoring.  The argument is a
     list of globbing patterns (in the sense of *note fnmatch: (fnmatch
     manual)fnmatch.) or extended regular expressions (*note Extended
     regular expressions: (sed)Extended regexps.) one of which must
     match the file name in order for the watcher to act on it.  A '!'
     in front of a pattern or regular expression indicates negation.
     Such construct matches if the file name doesn't match the pattern.
     Regular expressions must be surrounded by a pair of slashes,
     optionally followed by the following flags:

     b
          Use basic regular expressions.

     i
          Enable case-insensitive matching.

     For example:

          file ("*.cfg", "/.*\\.jpg/i");

     In this statement, the first string ('*.cfg') is treated as a shell
     globbing pattern.  The second one is a case-sensitive extended
     regular expression.

 -- Config: event STRING-LIST
     Configures the filesystem events to watch for in the directories
     declared by the 'path' statements.  The argument is a list of event
     names.  Both generic and system-dependent event namess are allowed.
     Multiple 'event' statements accumulate.

     A missing 'event' statement means "watch all events".

     For example:

          event (open,delete);

 -- Config: command STRING
     Defines a command to execute on event.  The STRING is a command
     line just as you would type it in 'sh'.  It may contain macro
     variables (*note macro expansion::), which will be expanded prior
     to execution.

     For example:

          command "/bin/prog -event $genev_name -file $file";

     *Note handler environment::, for a detailed discussion of how the
     command is executed.

 -- Config: user STRING
     Run command as this user.

 -- Config: timeout NUMBER
     Terminate the command if it runs longer than NUMBER seconds.  The
     default is 5 seconds.

 -- Config: option STRING-LIST
     A list of additional options.  The following options are defined:

     wait
          Wait for the program to terminate before handling next event
          from the event queue.  Normally the program runs
          asynchronously.

     stdout
          Capture the standard output of the command and redirect it to
          the syslog with the 'LOG_INFO' priority.

     stderr
          Capture the standard error of the command and redirect it to
          the syslog with the 'LOG_ERR' priority.

 -- Config: environ ENV-SPEC
     Modify command environment.  By default the command inherits the
     environment of 'direvent' augmented with the following variables:

     'DIREVENT_SYSEV_CODE'
          The system-dependent event code (*note the $sysev_code
          variable: $sysev_code.).
     'DIREVENT_SYSEV_NAME'
          The system-dependent event name or names (*note the
          '$sysev_name' variable: $sysev_name.).
     'DIREVENT_GENEV_CODE'
          The generic event code (*note the '$genev_code' variable:
          $genev_code.).
     'DIREVENT_GENEV_NAME'
          The generic event name or names (*note the '$genev_name'
          variable: $genev_name.).
     'DIREVENT_FILE'
          The name of the affected file relative to the current working
          directory (*note the '$file' variable: $file.).

     The 'environ' statement allows for trimming the environment.  Its
     argument is a list of environment modification directives.  Before
     applying, each directive undergoes macro expansion (*note macro
     expansion::).  The following directives are available:

     '-' (a single dash)
          Clear the inherited environment, but retain the variables
          added by 'direvent' itself.  The removed environment variables
          can be selectively restored using the directives discussed
          below.

          If used, this must be the first directive in the list.

     '--' (double-dash)
          Clear the entire environment, including the variables added by
          'direvent'.

          If used, this must be the first directive in the list.

     -NAME
          Unset the variable NAME.

     -NAME=VAL
          Unset the environment variable NAME only if its value is VAL.

     NAME
          Restore the environment variable NAME.  This directive is
          useful after '-' or '--' to retain some variables from the
          environment.

     NAME=VALUE
          Define environment variable NAME to have given VALUE.

     NAME+=VALUE
          Retain variable NAME and append VALUE to its existing value.
          If no such variable is present in the environment, it is
          created and VALUE is assigned to it.  However, if VALUE begins
          with a punctuation character, this character is removed from
          it before the assignment.  This is convenient for using this
          construct with environment variables like 'PATH', e.g.:

               PATH+=:/sbin

          In this example, if 'PATH' exists, ':/sbin' will be appended
          to it.  Otherwise, it will be created and '/sbin' will be
          assigned to it.

     NAME=+VALUE
          Retain variable NAME and prepend VALUE to its existing value.
          If no such variable is present in the environment, it is
          created and VALUE is assigned to it.  However, if VALUE ends
          with a punctuation character, this character is removed from
          it before assignment.

6 System Dependencies
*********************

'Direvent' relies on the event monitoring API provided by the kernel.


File: direvent.info,  Node: linux,  Next: bsd,  Up: System dependencies

6.1 GNU/Linux systems.
======================

On GNU/Linux the program uses 'inotify'.  *Note monitoring file system
events: (inotify(7))inotify.

   The maximum number of watches a user process can have is controlled
by the 'fs.inotify.max_user_watches' system variable.  Normally it is
set to 8192, which is quite enough for most purposes.  However, if you
monitor a big number or directories and/or are using recursive watchers,
you may need to increase this number.  In that case, use 'sysctl' (*note
configure kernel parameters at runtime: (sysctl(8))sysctl.) to raise the
limit, e.g.:

     sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=16384

Most GNU/Linux distributions provide the file '/etc/sysctl.conf' which
can be used to set this variable on startup.

   The following system-dependent events are defined on systems that use
'inotify':

ACCESS
     A file was accessed.
ATTRIB
     A file's metadata changed.
CLOSE_WRITE
     A writable file was closed.
CLOSE_NOWRITE
     An unwritable file closed.
CREATE
     A file was created.
DELETE
     A file was deleted.
MODIFY
     A file was modified.
MOVED_FROM
     A file was moved into a monitored directory.
MOVED_TO
     A file was moved out from a monitored directory.
OPEN
     A file was opened.


File: direvent.info,  Node: bsd,  Next: darwin,  Prev: linux,  Up: System dependencies

6.2 BSD systems
===============

When compiled on BSD systems (including Darwin), 'direvent' uses
'kqueue' (*note kernel event notification mechanism:
(kqueue(2))kqueue.).

   This interface needs an open file handle for each file in a monitored
directory, which means that the number of watchers is limited by the
maximum number of open files.  Use 'ulimit -n NUM' in order to raise it
to a higher number.

   Since it operates on files, 'kqueue' does not provide direct support
for the 'create' generic event.  'Direvent' works over this disadvantage
by keeping track of the contents of each monitored directory and
rescanning it each time a 'WRITE' system event is reported for it.  It
then generates the 'open' event for each file that appeared after the
last scan.  Such a rescan can consume considerable time if a directory
has a very large number of files in it.

   The following system-dependent events are available:

DELETE
     The 'unlink()' system call was called on the monitored file.
WRITE
     A write occurred on the file.
EXTEND
     The file was extended.
ATTRIB
     The file attributes have changed.
LINK
     The link count on the file changed.
RENAME
     The file was renamed.
REVOKE
     Access to the file was revoked via 'revoke()' (*note revoke file
     access: (revoke(2))revoke.) or the underlying file system was
     unmounted.


File: direvent.info,  Node: darwin,  Prev: bsd,  Up: System dependencies

6.3 Darwin (Mac OS X)
=====================

Essentially the same as BSD. The main difference compared to Linux and
BSD is that on Darwin the watchers are set after disconnecting from the
controlling terminal, because Darwin lacks the 'rfork' call and the
event queue cannot be inherited by the child process.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2014 Free Software Foundation,
     Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.

A.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
========================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
